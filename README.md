# Cryptocurrency-Lending
Source code for the thesis <em>Modelling and Simulation of Cryptocurrency Lending</em>. The source code is split into two independent parts.

**Data Gathering** is a simple application for the extraction of Ethereum on-chain transactions with the Etherscan.io APIs. Etherscan is a data gathering and retrieval system specifically designed for the Ethereum blockchain. The source code is designed for the free API plan (limited to five calls per second).

**Empirical Analysis** is a simple application validating the model introduced in the thesis <em>Modelling and Simulation of Cryptocurrency Lending</em>. The thesis is available on https://dash.harvard.edu. This part contains the non-linear optimization and the empirical tests needed to validate the model.
